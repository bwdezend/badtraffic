BadTraffic version 1.3.3
========================

BadTraffic is a perl-based firewall managment tool, used to allow a
group of systems to share a firewall block list.  The block lists 
are maintained in MySQL, and are accessed via DBD.

BadTraffic currently supports iptables on Linux (tested primarily
on RHEL5/6) and  ipfw on Mac OS X (tested primarily on Snow Leopard
and Lion).  BadTraffic also works on Solaris using the route command
to manage blackhole routes (primarily tested on Solaris 8). The route
solution is pretty ugly, and will likely be dropped at some point in
the future.
