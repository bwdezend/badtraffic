README - launchd jobs
=====================

These are launchd jobs suitable for OSX Lion.  They assume that the
BadTraffic module is loaded and the tools have been copied into
/local/badtraffic/bin.  To use the jobs, simply add them to
/Library/LaunchDaemons and load them:

  cp net.gurucollege.badtraffic* /Library/LaunchDaemons
  cd /Library/LaunchDaemons
  sudo launchctl load net.gurucollege.badtraffic-blocker.plist
  sudo launchctl load net.gurucollege.badtraffic-ssh-scanner.plist
